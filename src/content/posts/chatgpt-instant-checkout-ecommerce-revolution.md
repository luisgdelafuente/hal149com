# ChatGPT Instant Checkout: Revolution in E-commerce?

## A frictionless shopping experience

**ChatGPT's Instant Checkout** feature is transforming e-commerce by allowing users to buy product or services directly within a conversation, without leaving the chat.

This integration eliminates intermediate steps and keeps the user focused, which can significantly increase conversion rates and reduce cart abandonment. OpenAI implemented this feature with the <a href="https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/" rel="nofollow">Agentic Commerce Protocol</a>, designed to connect merchants and users securely and efficiently.

## What is the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)?

ACP is an <a href="https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/stripe-openai-instant-checkout" rel="nofollow">open standard created by OpenAI and Stripe</a> that allows AI agents and merchants to communicate through a "common language," simplifying orders, payments, and support from the same ChatGPT interface.

Thus, when a user searches for products, ChatGPT can process the entire transaction without redirecting them to external websites. This standard also prioritizes security: the agent never stores payment methods or sensitive data, avoiding risks and strengthening user privacy.

## Advantages for stores and businesses

This advancement is especially useful for small stores and small businesses. It allows, for example, offering subscriptions, registrations, or offers without leaving the conversation—bringing the experience much closer to what you would get with a human salesperson or advisor.

And it implies something even more important: it opens a **new marketing and sales channel to new customers**. AI platforms will now have the incentive to connect conversations and products in a highly relevant way.

Users enjoy <a href="https://www.eesel.ai/blog/chatgpt-instant-checkout" rel="nofollow">personalized recommendations</a> based on their preferences and history, which optimizes time and organization for sellers.

## How instant purchase works

When the user searches for a product, ChatGPT offers suggestions and shows a purchase button if that merchant has Instant Checkout mode enabled. When clicked, the user can complete the purchase in seconds, including payment confirmation and shipping.

Currently, this feature is <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/29/openai-rolls-out-purchases-direct-from-chatgpt-in-a-radical-shift-to-e-commerce-and-direct-challenge-to-google/" rel="nofollow">natively enabled for many US merchants</a>, including stores on Etsy or Shopify, and promises **to expand to other markets soon**.

## Challenges and opportunities

Although ease of use is an advantage, the challenges include the need for merchants to manage post-sale processes (exchanges, returns, personalized support) outside the ChatGPT ecosystem.

Additionally, platforms will need to offer mechanisms to maintain the direct brand-customer relationship, even with AI mediation. This deserves a separate analysis because it will become very relevant soon.

<a href="https://shiftasia.com/column/how-instant-checkout-and-the-agentic-commerce-protocol-redefine-ecommerce/" rel="nofollow">It's still early to anticipate</a> if this technology will extend to all forms of e-commerce.

But I believe it's another step in a trend that will make a good part of websites obsolete. The reason: users will prefer in many cases the more human interaction of a single AI over the design and usability criteria of each separate website.

**Ready to sell or buy from chat?** The ChatGPT Instant Checkout integration is just the beginning of a new era where AI simplifies the experience and digital commerce for everyone.
