# Is Google deindexing your web page (and instead promoting TikTok, Reddit and YouTube)?

Since late May 2025, billions of web pages have been removed from Google's index. Many website administrators have noticed that their content no longer appears in search results, and if you use Google Search Console you've probably seen a sudden drop in the number of indexed pages since **May 20th or 28th**.

## What's happening with Google's index?

Google hasn't issued a clear official explanation, but multiple SEO experts have formulated theories about this massive cleanup. One of the most accepted theories is that **Google is prioritizing <a href="https://www.adsmurai.com/es/articulos/todo-sobre-contenido-generado-usuario-ugc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">user-generated content (UGC)</a>** —that is, posts on social platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Reddit and Instagram.

This change responds to a technical and user experience need. **It's cheaper and more efficient for Google and its AI platforms to store and deliver short videos or social posts than to maintain complete web pages**, many of which contain duplicate, outdated or irrelevant content.

## The rise of user-generated content

According to recent data, the most clicked sites from Google are no longer traditional sites but UGC platforms:

- 📹 **YouTube** is number one
- 📘 **Facebook** takes second place
- 👽 **Reddit** and 🟣 **Instagram** are in the top 5
- 🎵 **TikTok** and 🧠 **LinkedIn** are also gaining prominence

Additionally, platforms like Instagram and YouTube have experienced historic peaks in the amount of **organic keywords** they're ranking for, indicating a massive boost in traffic from Google Search.

## What type of pages is Google deindexing?

In many cases, Google is removing pages considered "low value": thin content, duplicate, outdated or out of context regarding the site's central theme. The loss of <a href="https://moz.com/blog/topical-authority" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">topical authority</a> also influences this, an increasingly relevant factor in search algorithms.

However, even sites with good quality content have reported losses in the index. This suggests that **Google is making space for new, more dynamic content**: social posts, short videos, and apps with unique data generated by AI or users.

## Why do short videos dominate modern SEO?

**Short videos (Shorts, Reels, TikToks)** are performing extraordinarily well on Google for several reasons:

- They're faster to consume and share
- They capture user attention better
- They convey authenticity and human connection
- They adapt perfectly to mobile and fast connections

Additionally, it's possible to do SEO with video. Creators who position their videos correctly (using the keyword in the title, description and within the spoken content) can dominate keywords before the space becomes competitive.

## What can you do to adapt?

If your site has lost pages in the index, it's time to act. Here are some key actions:

- 🔍 Review your **topical authority** and reinforce with quality, updated content
- 🎯 Create content for social platforms that also targets your main keywords
- 🎥 Start producing **SEO-optimized short videos**
- 🧠 Use tools like <a href="https://www.descript.com/es" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Descript</a> for efficient editing
- 📊 Consider automated publishing services across multiple platforms

## The new reality of digital marketing

This massive change in Google's index is not temporary. We're seeing a fundamental transformation in how search engines work and where information is consumed.

Companies that continue to rely exclusively on their traditional website to generate organic traffic will face increasingly greater challenges. The strategy now requires a **multi-platform presence**, with special emphasis on short video content and participation in online communities.
