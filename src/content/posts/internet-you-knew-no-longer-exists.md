# The internet you knew no longer exists

It has changed more in the last 6 months than in the entire previous decade. And if your business still depends on organic traffic, you're in trouble.

The numbers are brutal: 10 years ago Google sent 1 visitor for every 2 pages it indexed. 6 months ago it was already 1 visitor for every 6 pages. **Today it's 1 visitor for every 18 pages.**

The reason? 90% of searches are now answered directly on Google without users visiting your website. Your content is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/rolling-stone-billboard-owner-penske-sues-google-over-ai-overviews-2025-09-14/" rel="nofollow">used to feed AI responses</a>, but you don't see a single click.

## We're living through the "Napster moment" of digital marketing

Just like the music industry took years to understand that the model had changed forever, many businesses continue creating content for an ecosystem that no longer exists.

## What does this mean for your business?

- SEO evolves toward a new meaning: "Search Everywhere Optimization", which implies presence on more platforms (AI, YouTube, etc.)
- Organic content no longer generates the ROI it used to; short content to solve specific problems and queries is now essential
- You need to pivot NOW to strategies that work in 2025 and 2026

## My immediate recommendation:

1. **Micro-segmented audiences**, instead of massive ones
2. **AI platform presence** - start working on it step by step
3. **Experiences** beyond reading: calculators, simulators, etc.

Those who adapt now will dominate. Those who wait will become the Blockbuster of digital marketing.
