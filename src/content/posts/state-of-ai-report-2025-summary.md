## The new AI paradigm: 2025 in perspective

The latest edition of the <a href="https://www.stateof.ai/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">State of AI Report</a> marks a before and after in the technology industry by highlighting that competitive advantage no longer depends solely on the smartest model, but on how companies optimize cost, distribution, and infrastructure to generate value.

### Capacity and cost: a hidden exponential accelerator

According to the report, intelligence per dollar is doubling every 3 to 8 months, far exceeding the historic Moore's Law. This forces companies to design architectures that <em>route</em> tasks to the cheapest and most capable model, rather than always using the most advanced models. You can delve deeper into this data in this <a href="https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/executive-briefing-i-summarized-the?r=1z4sm5&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=substack" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">executive briefing by Nate B. Jones</a>.

### Distribution: "Answer engines" change the game rules

The growth of AI-based search engines, such as ChatGPT and Perplexity, is displacing traditional SEO towards optimization for answer engines or <strong>Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)</strong>. This change is crucial as <a href="https://monica.im/es_419/features/youtube-summary-with-chatgpt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">conversion rates</a> of over 11% are already being reported.

### Physical infrastructure: the real bottleneck

Ambitious projects like Stargate aim to build mega power and cooling plants to support AI expansion, but energy and water scarcity represents a real limit. According to <a href="https://semianalysis.com/p/the-ai-hardware-power-struggle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a SemiAnalysis study</a>, this physical challenge adds complexity and conditions the continuity of growth.

### Real measurement of reasoning and economic capabilities

The report highlights that improvements in "intelligence" are more fragile than they appear. To measure real value, tools like OpenAI's GDP-val evaluate how AI contributes to solving substantive economic tasks.

### Open vs closed ecosystem

China leads the open-weights models terrain, which allows them flexibility and sovereignty, while the United States continues with <a href="https://huggingface.co/models" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">closed or hybrid models</a>. This mixed ecosystem will be the protagonist, combining frontier models for critical tasks with open models for massive load.

### Personal initiative

The drastic reduction in the cost of intelligence multiplies opportunities to learn and undertake. Understanding and mastering these systems will be key to standing out in the new digital era. However, few or very few will take advantage of this advantage actively, on their own initiative.

***

This cycle marks a structural change in AI: it's no longer just a matter of more powerful models, but of integrated systems that manage costs, distribution and infrastructure, with efficiency as the key to success in 2025 and 2026.
