Let's review how AI could be impacting the present and future of education and related trends.

## From Just in Case to Just in Time Learning

The way we approach education is undergoing a fundamental shift. For too long, the focus has been on comprehensive courses, often covering vast amounts of information that may or may not be relevant to the individual learner. This "just in case" model is becoming increasingly obsolete.

### The "just in time" approach

Instead of broad, pre-packaged courses, learners need access to information and assistance precisely when they require it to solve specific problems. This requires a change in mindset, moving away from passive content consumption to active problem-solving.

JIT learning is not a new idea. In fact, it's been around for more than 10 years. However, it is only now, with the advent of AI, that this concept can truly become mainstream. 

> "Just-In-Time means learning something only when/because you actually need to use it. But Just-In-Case is the predominant model for most forms of education (and most user manuals). Just-In-Case knowledge is easier to present, but harder to learn, understand, and remember. Much harder." - *Kathy Sierra, Badass: Making Users Awesome*


## Rethinking Education Businesses with AI

For those involved in building education businesses, the implications are profound. Instead of designing traditional courses, the idea would be to focus on applications that deliver solutions to specific problems as they arise. 

This "just in time" approach allows for greater flexibility, responsiveness, and ultimately, more effective learning outcomes.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the technology enabling this transformation. Powerful AI tools can interact with learners in real-time, providing immediate answers to questions, locating relevant information from diverse sources (such as online videos and manuals), and even taking actions on the user's behalf. This creates a personalized and highly efficient learning experience.

The most effective AI learning tools leverage integration across different platforms and services. Seamless access to information from various sources, such as search engines, email, calendars, and maps, empowers learners to effectively solve problems and achieve their learning goals.

## Monetizing Expertise in the AI Era

The traditional model of selling courses is being challenged. One viable alternative is to offer ongoing personal support and mentorship, complementing AI's capabilities with human expertise. This "human-in-the-loop" approach provides valuable guidance, helps learners navigate challenges, and offers a more personalized learning experience.

The future of education is about empowering learners to become effective problem solvers. By embracing AI and adapting to this new landscape, educators and business leaders can create more dynamic, personalized, and impactful learning experiences.
