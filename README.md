# PROJECT POLICIES

The following rules must be always followed to work in this project and keep this document updated:

1) **Roadmap must always be clean**, with clear steps and brief names for versions, phases and tasks. NO detailed descriptions here.
2) **Details about challenges and complex tasks** will be included in the corresponding chapter "CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS"
3) **AI Never launches commands on the console**, the user will do it manually at the request of the AI, or to proceed with the testing of the development.
4) I don¬¥t always need a complete description of the work done, only when it has implied a significant amount of work, trials or errors. You can finish each task with a small briefing and ask me to test it. 

This README serves as the primary reference for understanding the project structure, deployment process, and development roadmap. All AI assistants should consult this document before making modifications.

# Project Description

Official name of the project HAL149

A complete, best-in-class Astro website for a business agency with all the features needed to present the company, offerings, news, git-hosted images, ultra-optimized for SEO, and more.

# Challenges & Solutions

### Render-Blocking CSS Performance Issue ‚ùå **NOT SOLVED**
**Problem**: 430ms render-blocking CSS delays affecting Core Web Vitals scores.
**Status**: Optimization attempts broke website layout, changes reverted.

### Language Switcher Functionality ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Language switcher only worked on homepage.
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive URL generation utilities for all page types.
**Status**: Works across all pages (homepage, blog posts, archives, navigation).

### Netlify Forms Integration ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Dynamic modal forms not detected by Netlify.
**Solution**: Dual-form approach with hidden static form + dynamic modal.
**Status**: Forms working with multilingual support and spam protection.

### Blog Post Content Formatting ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Poor code block contrast, missing list bullets, CSS conflicts.
**Solution**: High-specificity CSS selectors with global styling.
**Status**: Magazine-quality typography with proper code highlighting.

### Responsive Image Optimization ‚ùå **REVERTED**
**Problem**: Google PageSpeed reports 90KB+ savings possible on blog post images. Mobile devices receive full-size (800px) images when displaying at 379px, causing unnecessary bandwidth usage and poor LCP scores.
**Previous Solution Attempt**: Custom ResponsivePostImage component with asset mapping was implemented but reverted due to user request.
**Current Status**: ‚ùå **REVERTED** - All image optimization changes have been undone. Images are back to using regular `<img>` tags from `/public/` folder. Performance optimization priority moved to CSS render-blocking issues.

### CSS Render-Blocking Optimization ‚ùå **NOT SOLVED**
**Problem**: 430ms render-blocking CSS delays affecting Core Web Vitals scores.
**Current Status**: Optimization attempts broke website layout, changes reverted.
**Solution Approach**:
- **Step 1**: Identify critical above-the-fold CSS classes
- **Step 2**: Create inline critical CSS for immediate rendering
- **Step 3**: Defer non-critical CSS loading with preload
- **Step 4**: Test layout integrity across all pages
**Status**: Pending implementation in Phase 7.2

### LCP Request Discovery ‚ùå **NOT SOLVED**
**Problem**: Google Speed Test reports LCP image not discoverable from HTML immediately, affecting Largest Contentful Paint performance.
**Solution Approach**:
- **Step 1**: Identify the LCP element (likely hero image)
- **Step 2**: Ensure LCP image is loaded without lazy-loading
- **Step 3**: Optimize image loading priority and preloading
**Status**: Pending implementation in Phase 7.7

### Network Dependency Tree Optimization ‚ùå **NOT SOLVED**
**Problem**: Critical request chains are too long, affecting page load performance and LCP scores.
**Solution Approach**:
- **Step 1**: Analyze critical request chains
- **Step 2**: Reduce chain length by optimizing resource loading order
- **Step 3**: Defer non-critical resources
- **Step 4**: Optimize resource sizes
**Status**: Pending implementation in Phase 7.8

### Responsive Menu Implementation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Problem**: Mobile menu was not fully responsive - only contact and language buttons visible on smartphones, missing navigation menu.
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive mobile menu system with:
- **Mobile Menu Component**: Full-screen overlay with navigation links and language switcher
- **Hamburger Button**: Accessible hamburger menu button with proper ARIA attributes
- **Responsive Layout**: Desktop shows full navigation, mobile shows contact + hamburger
- **Language Integration**: Mobile menu includes language switcher with proper translations
- **Accessibility Features**: Keyboard navigation, focus management, screen reader support
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions for menu open/close with backdrop blur
- **Body Scroll Lock**: Prevents background scrolling when menu is open
- **Header Language Switcher**: Language switcher remains in header for both desktop and mobile for better accessibility
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Fully functional responsive menu with multilingual support

### Language Switcher Multiple Instance Fix ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Problem**: Language switcher not working in responsive mode due to static IDs causing conflicts between desktop and mobile instances.
**Solution**: Implemented event delegation approach:
- **Event Delegation**: Single document-level event listeners handle all language switcher instances
- **Class-based targeting**: Replaced static IDs with classes to avoid conflicts
- **Robust element finding**: Used `closest()` method for reliable element targeting
- **Automatic cleanup**: Closes other menus when opening a new one
- **Independent functionality**: Each instance works independently without interference
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Language switcher now works perfectly in both desktop and mobile modes

### Navigation Menu Order Issue ‚ùå **NOT SOLVED**
**Problem**: Navigation menu displaying in wrong order (Blog, Pricing, Projects, Register, Services) instead of desired order (Services, Projects, Blog, Pricing, Register).
**Attempted Solutions**:
- **CSS Flexbox Fix**: Removed conflicting CSS classes (`col-span-6`, `self-stretch`) and simplified navigation layout
- **Data Source Verification**: Confirmed JSON files have correct order in both English and Spanish
- **Debug Output**: Added debug logging showing data arrives in wrong order despite correct JSON
- **Hardcoded Test**: Temporarily hardcoded navigation array to verify rendering works correctly
- **Layout Debug**: Added console logging to trace data flow from JSON to component
**Root Cause**: Unknown - Data appears correct in JSON files but arrives at component in wrong order
**Status**: ‚ùå **NOT SOLVED** - Menu order remains incorrect despite all attempted fixes
