# PROJECT POLICIES

The following rules must be always followed to work in this project and keep this document updated:

1) Roadmap must always be clean, with clear steps and brief names for versions, phases and tasks. NO detailed descriptions here.
2) Details about challenges and complex tasks** will be included in the corresponding chapter "CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS"
3) AI Never launches commands on the console, the user will do it manually at the request of the AI, or to proceed with the testing of the development.
4) I don¬¥t always need a complete description of the work done, only when it has implied a significant amount of work, trials or errors. You can finish each task with a small briefing and ask me to test it. 

This README serves as the primary reference for understanding the project structure, deployment process, and development roadmap. All AI assistants should consult this document before making modifications.

# Challenges & Solutions

### Automatic Language Detection ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Middleware-based language detection didn't work in production because the site uses static output mode, where middleware only runs during development.
**Solution**: Implemented client-side JavaScript detection using `navigator.language` on homepage. Spanish speakers are automatically redirected to `/es/` on first visit, with cookie persistence for returning users.

### Render-Blocking CSS Performance Issue ‚ùå **NOT SOLVED**
**Problem**: 430ms render-blocking CSS delays affecting Core Web Vitals scores.
**Status**: Optimization attempts broke website layout, changes reverted.

### Language Switcher Functionality ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Language switcher only worked on homepage.
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive URL generation utilities for all page types.
**Status**: Works across all pages (homepage, blog posts, archives, navigation).

### Netlify Forms Integration ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Dynamic modal forms not detected by Netlify.
**Solution**: Dual-form approach with hidden static form + dynamic modal.
**Status**: Forms working with multilingual support and spam protection.

### Blog Post Content Formatting ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Poor code block contrast, missing list bullets, CSS conflicts.
**Solution**: High-specificity CSS selectors with global styling.
**Status**: Magazine-quality typography with proper code highlighting.

### Responsive Image Optimization ‚ùå **NOT SOLVED**
**Problem**: Google PageSpeed reports that mobile devices receive 800px images when displaying at 379px, causing unnecessary bandwidth usage.
**Initial Solution Attempt**: Implemented dynamic glob imports with Astro's Image component and smaller mobile breakpoints.
**Implementation**:
- Dynamic image loading: `import.meta.glob<{ default: ImageMetadata }>('/src/assets/blog-images/*.{jpeg,jpg,png,webp}')`
- Mobile-optimized widths: `[320, 400, 600, 800, 1200]`
- Responsive sizes: `(max-width: 380px) 320px, (max-width: 480px) 400px, (max-width: 768px) 90vw, (max-width: 1200px) 70vw, 800px`
- Created OptimizedLogo component for logo images with appropriate sizing
**Recent Attempts (Failed)**:
- Updated sizes attribute in blog post templates to be more specific about mobile dimensions
- Discovered Astro won't upscale images - only generates sizes smaller than original
- Removed 1200px from widths array since original images are ~1024px wide
- Final widths configuration: `[320, 400, 600, 800]`
**Current Status**: Despite multiple attempts, responsive images still not working correctly. Astro generates only 600px and original size, not the smaller mobile sizes (320px, 400px) needed.
**Root Cause**: Unknown - Astro Image component not generating all specified widths despite correct configuration.

### CSS Render-Blocking Optimization ‚ùå **NOT SOLVED**
**Problem**: 430ms render-blocking CSS delays affecting Core Web Vitals scores.
**Current Status**: Optimization attempts broke website layout, changes reverted.
**Solution Approach**:
- **Step 1**: Identify critical above-the-fold CSS classes
- **Step 2**: Create inline critical CSS for immediate rendering
- **Step 3**: Defer non-critical CSS loading with preload
- **Step 4**: Test layout integrity across all pages
**Status**: Pending implementation in Phase 7.2

### LCP Request Discovery ‚ùå **NOT SOLVED**
**Problem**: Google Speed Test reports LCP image not discoverable from HTML immediately, affecting Largest Contentful Paint performance.
**Solution Approach**:
- **Step 1**: Identify the LCP element (likely hero image)
- **Step 2**: Ensure LCP image is loaded without lazy-loading
- **Step 3**: Optimize image loading priority and preloading
**Status**: Pending implementation in Phase 7.7

### Network Dependency Tree Optimization ‚ùå **NOT SOLVED**
**Problem**: Critical request chains are too long, affecting page load performance and LCP scores.
**Solution Approach**:
- **Step 1**: Analyze critical request chains
- **Step 2**: Reduce chain length by optimizing resource loading order
- **Step 3**: Defer non-critical resources
- **Step 4**: Optimize resource sizes
**Status**: Pending implementation in Phase 7.8

### Company Metadata & Social Sharing Issues ‚ùå **NOT SOLVED**
**Problem**: Multiple metadata issues detected affecting SEO and social media sharing functionality.
**Issues Identified**:
- **Non-functional WhatsApp thumbs**: WhatsApp sharing not displaying proper preview images
- **Wrong apple icons**: Apple touch icons may not be properly configured for all devices
- **Missing social metadata**: Company pages (about, credits, thank-you) lack proper Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags
- **Incomplete SEO implementation**: Some company pages missing proper meta descriptions and keywords
- **Social image optimization**: Current 1200x630 images may not be optimal for all social platforms
**Solution Approach**:
- **Step 1**: Implement comprehensive metadata for all company pages
- **Step 2**: Add WhatsApp-specific meta tags and image optimization
- **Step 3**: Fix apple touch icon configuration and add missing icon sizes
- **Step 4**: Enhance existing blog post metadata implementation
- **Step 5**: Create platform-specific social media preview images
**Status**: Pending implementation in Phase 6A (Metadata Deployment & SEO Optimization)

### Responsive Menu Implementation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Problem**: Mobile menu was not fully responsive - only contact and language buttons visible on smartphones, missing navigation menu.
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive mobile menu system with:
- **Mobile Menu Component**: Full-screen overlay with navigation links and language switcher
- **Hamburger Button**: Accessible hamburger menu button with proper ARIA attributes
- **Responsive Layout**: Desktop shows full navigation, mobile shows contact + hamburger
- **Language Integration**: Mobile menu includes language switcher with proper translations
- **Accessibility Features**: Keyboard navigation, focus management, screen reader support
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions for menu open/close with backdrop blur
- **Body Scroll Lock**: Prevents background scrolling when menu is open
- **Header Language Switcher**: Language switcher remains in header for both desktop and mobile for better accessibility
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Fully functional responsive menu with multilingual support

### Language Switcher Multiple Instance Fix ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Problem**: Language switcher not working in responsive mode due to static IDs causing conflicts between desktop and mobile instances.
**Solution**: Implemented event delegation approach:
- **Event Delegation**: Single document-level event listeners handle all language switcher instances
- **Class-based targeting**: Replaced static IDs with classes to avoid conflicts
- **Robust element finding**: Used `closest()` method for reliable element targeting
- **Automatic cleanup**: Closes other menus when opening a new one
- **Independent functionality**: Each instance works independently without interference
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Language switcher now works perfectly in both desktop and mobile modes

### Navigation Menu Order Issue ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Navigation menu displaying in wrong order (Blog, Pricing, Projects, Register, Services) instead of desired order (Services, Projects, Blog, Pricing, Register).
**Root Cause**: Conflicting data sources - i18n content files had incorrect navigation order while fallback file had correct order.
**Solution**: Fixed navigation order in both `src/i18n/content/en.json` and `src/i18n/content/es.json` to match the correct order from the fallback file.
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Navigation menu now displays in correct order across all languages

### Desktop Header Button Height Inconsistency ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** 
**Problem**: Language button (EN/ES) and Contact button (Contact/Contacto) display different heights on desktop viewport, creating visual inconsistency in the header.

**Root Cause**: 
- CSS specificity conflict when trying to use responsive class switching (`bs-btn-mobile md:bs-btn`)
- Tailwind's `@apply` directive compiles classes at build time into fixed CSS rules
- Responsive utility overrides (`md:px-5 md:py-4 md:text-base`) cannot properly override `@apply`-generated CSS due to specificity and cascade issues
- The mobile properties (px-3 py-2 text-sm) from `bs-btn-mobile` persisted on desktop even with responsive overrides

**Failed Attempts** (6-7 iterations):
1. Using `bs-btn-mobile md:bs-btn` pattern - classes conflict
2. Adding responsive utilities `md:px-5 md:py-4 md:text-base` - insufficient override power
3. Modifying CSS with explicit `text-base` in `.bs-btn` - didn't resolve height mismatch
4. Various combinations of responsive classes - all failed due to `@apply` directive limitations

**Nuclear Solution** (Final - Works):
- **Abandoned responsive class approach entirely**
- **Created TWO separate language switcher instances** (mirrors Contact button pattern exactly):
  - Desktop: `<div class="language-switcher hidden md:block">` with `bs-btn` class
  - Mobile: `<div class="language-switcher md:hidden">` with `bs-btn-mobile` class
- Each instance has its own button with the appropriate class - NO responsive overrides needed
- JavaScript event delegation handles both instances seamlessly

**Final Implementation**:
- Desktop Language button: `class="language-toggle bs-btn flex items-center justify-center"` (hidden on mobile)
- Mobile Language button: `class="language-toggle bs-btn-mobile flex items-center justify-center"` (hidden on desktop)
- Contact button Desktop: `class="bs-btn"`
- Contact button Mobile: `class="bs-btn-mobile"`
- **All buttons now match perfectly in their respective viewports**

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/LanguageSwitcher.astro` - Split into separate desktop/mobile instances

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Desktop language button now matches Contact button height exactly. Mobile buttons remain unchanged. Solution uses the exact same pattern as Contact button (separate instances, no responsive class hacks).

## üéØ NEXT SESSION: LCP Performance Action Plan

### **Current Status (as of optimization session):**
- **LCP Time**: ~2,500-2,700ms (target: <2,500ms)
- **Main Issues**: Render delay (1,570ms), CSS blocking (180ms), oversized mobile images (19.5 KiB wasted)

### **Priority Action Plan:**

#### **Priority 1: LCP Render Delay Investigation (CRITICAL)** üî¥
**Problem**: 1,570ms render delay (28% of LCP time) after image loads
**Impact**: Largest bottleneck - fixing this could save 1,000-1,500ms
**Actions**:
1. Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab to trace render delay
2. Check for JavaScript blocking render
3. Analyze CSS cascade/specificity issues
4. Look for layout thrashing or reflows
5. Consider preload hint for LCP image: `<link rel="preload" as="image" href="..." fetchpriority="high">`

#### **Priority 2: CSS Critical Path Optimization** üü°
**Problem**: 9.5 KiB CSS still blocking render for 180ms despite consolidation
**Impact**: Moderate - 180ms delay in critical path
**Actions**:
1. Extract critical above-the-fold CSS (~2-3 KiB)
2. Inline critical CSS in `<head>`
3. Load remaining CSS asynchronously
4. Consider splitting CSS: critical (inline) + deferred (async)
5. Alternative: Use `media="print" onload="this.media='all'"` trick

#### **Priority 3: Responsive Image Sizing** üü¢
**Problem**: 800x450 image served when 379x213 displayed on mobile (19.5 KiB wasted)
**Impact**: Minor - only 19.5 KiB, but affects mobile UX
**Actions**:
1. Debug why Astro not generating 320w/400w srcset variants
2. Check if source images are large enough for Astro to downscale
3. Review Astro Image component configuration
4. Consider manual srcset generation if Astro fails
5. Test with different `widths` array configurations

#### **Priority 4: Network Dependency Chain** üü°
**Problem**: 1,041ms critical path latency (HTML ‚Üí CSS chain)
**Impact**: Moderate - CSS depends on HTML load
**Actions**:
1. Add `<link rel="preload" href="/assets/styles.css" as="style">` in head
2. Consider HTTP/2 Server Push for CSS (if supported by Netlify)
3. Optimize TTFB (currently 740ms - could be faster)
4. Review Netlify CDN configuration

---

### **Quick Wins (Low Effort, Medium Impact):**

1. **Add LCP Image Preload** (5 minutes):
   ```html
   <link rel="preload" as="image" href="{post.data.image}" fetchpriority="high">
   ```

2. **Add CSS Preload** (2 minutes):
   ```html
   <link rel="preload" href="/assets/styles.css" as="style">
   ```

3. **Reduce CSS Bundle Size** (30 minutes):
   - Review blog-post.css for unused styles
   - Remove duplicate styles between main.css and blog-post.css
   - Consider PurgeCSS for production builds

---

### **Investigation Tools:**

1. **Chrome DevTools Performance Tab**:
   - Record page load
   - Look for long tasks (>50ms)
   - Check render-blocking resources
   - Analyze main thread activity

2. **WebPageTest.org**:
   - Detailed waterfall analysis
   - Filmstrip view to see rendering timeline
   - Connection view to see dependency chains

3. **Lighthouse CI**:
   - Set up automated performance testing
   - Track performance over time
   - Catch regressions early

---

**Last Updated:** Phase 7 progress documented. Completed: LCP lazy loading fix, CSS consolidation, image quality optimization. Remaining: Render delay investigation, CSS critical path, responsive images.
