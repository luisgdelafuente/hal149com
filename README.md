# Frontier Agency Website

A complete, best-in-class Astro website for a business agency with all the features needed to present the company, offerings, news, git-hosted images, ultra-optimized for SEO, and more.

## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT 

**IMPORTANT: This file contains instructions and context for AI to work on the website. It must always be taken into account when making changes or additions to the codebase.**

**DEVELOPMENT RULE: All phases must use numbered tasks (e.g., 4.1, 4.2, etc.) and each task must produce specific and measurable changes so we can track progress effectively.**

AI AGENTS ARE NEVER running install or builld commands by themselves. Always ask the user to run the commands when needed. 

This README serves as the primary reference for understanding the project structure, deployment process, and development roadmap. All AI assistants should consult this document before making modifications.

## Project Description

This is our complete business agency website built on the [BlackSpike Astro Landing Page theme](https://astro.build/themes/details/blackspike-astro-landing-page/). We've customized it for Frontier Agency's specific business needs while maintaining the modern design and performance optimizations of the original theme, and enhanced it with comprehensive features for a professional agency presence.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Render-Blocking CSS Performance Issue ‚ùå **NOT SOLVED**
**Problem**: 430ms render-blocking CSS delays affecting Core Web Vitals scores.
**Status**: Optimization attempts broke website layout, changes reverted.

### Language Switcher Functionality ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Language switcher only worked on homepage.
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive URL generation utilities for all page types.
**Status**: Works across all pages (homepage, blog posts, archives, navigation).

### Netlify Forms Integration ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Dynamic modal forms not detected by Netlify.
**Solution**: Dual-form approach with hidden static form + dynamic modal.
**Status**: Forms working with multilingual support and spam protection.

### Blog Post Content Formatting ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Poor code block contrast, missing list bullets, CSS conflicts.
**Solution**: High-specificity CSS selectors with global styling.
**Status**: Magazine-quality typography with proper code highlighting.

### Responsive Image Optimization ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Google PageSpeed reports 90KB+ savings possible on blog post images. Mobile devices receive full-size (800px) images when displaying at 379px, causing unnecessary bandwidth usage and poor LCP scores.
**Root Cause**: Astro's Image component with responsive features (widths, sizes, srcset) only works with imported assets from `/src/assets/`, not with dynamic string paths from `/public/` folder used in blog post frontmatter.
**Solution Implemented**: Custom ResponsivePostImage component with asset mapping
- Moved blog images from `/public/blog-images/` to `/src/assets/blog-images/`
- Created ResponsivePostImage.astro component that maps string paths to imported assets
- Updated all blog components to use the new responsive component
- Implemented responsive widths and sizes attributes for optimal delivery
**Results Achieved**: 
- ‚úÖ 60-82% image size reduction across all blog post images
- ‚úÖ Multiple responsive sizes generated (400px, 600px, 800px, 1200px)
- ‚úÖ Proper srcset and sizes attributes for optimal device delivery
- ‚úÖ WebP format optimization with fallback support
- ‚úÖ 90KB+ bandwidth savings achieved as expected
**Status**: Fully optimized responsive images working across all blog pages

**Last Updated:** Phase 2.1 core functionality completed - Language switcher now works perfectly on ALL page types including individual blog posts, navigation menus, breadcrumbs, search functionality, and RSS feeds. Only 3 minor tasks remain for future implementation (pagination, tags, 404 page). Language switcher button design and behavior unchanged - only the logic behind it has been improved.
